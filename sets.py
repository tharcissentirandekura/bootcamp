#looking at sets data type in python.

"""
- Sets same as in mathematics, does not allow two identical elements in it.
eg. set names students_grade = {1,2,3,4,5}
- we cann't have this : students_grade = {1,1,2,3,4,5}
- In sets there is no duplicate elemts.

#operation :
1. find difference : setsnameA.diffrence(setsnameB)
2. remove the elements that are in A but not in B : A.difference_update(B)
3. remove an element : A.remove(elementname)
etc
if you want to know more to do on sets: go in terminal, type pyton3 then create a set call it any name and then do dir(setname)
"""
#create an empty set
name = set()
#create an empy list 
name = list()
#create an empty dictionnary
name = dict()
# create an empty tuple
name = tuple()
