"""
1. = : used for assignment.
eg. name = "jerome"
    newname = "jerome"

2. == : comparison equality.
eg. name == newname


print(name == newname) will return True because the data values are the same.

3. >= : greater than or equal to
4. <= : less than or equal to
5. > : greater than 
6. < : less than
7. != : not equal: checking if two things are not the same
