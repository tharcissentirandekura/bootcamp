names = "jerome"
age = 21
country = "Burundi"

# print("The name is :",names,"the age is :",age,"and he country is from :",country)

#print(f"The name is  {names} the age is {age} and teh country is  {country}") # this is more useful 

# difference in printing when involving integers and strings.

# To convert from string to integer: use str()
#

a = 12
#strin a will be str(a)
b = '10'
print(a + int(b))

print("The number a is :", str(a))

# How to  convert things in python

# from string to integer : use int()
# from int to string : use str()
# from float to int : int()
# from int to float : float int()

# For some types of strings, they can't be turned into integers:

"""
for example: a = '12'
to convert a tp integer we do : int(a)

But if a is equal to "burundi"
a = "burundi", you can't turn it into integer.

        c = a + b
